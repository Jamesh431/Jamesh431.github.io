          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a junior software developer, fueled by a creative spirit and a
            skill set encompassing different technologies. These include
            JavaScript, Python, React, PSQL, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, HTML, CSS,
            and SCSS.
          </p>

          <p>
            I find joy in problem-solving and the satisfaction of crafting
            effective solutions. I've actively contributed to essential
            components such as pagination systems, automated data collection and
            sorting tools, engaging carousels, and more. I am a fast learner and
            always up for learning new technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond coding, my creative side finds expression through playing the
            guitar. This hobby not only enriches my life with music but also
            reflects my passion for creating beautiful things, whether in code
            or in melodies.
          </p>

          <p>
            I invite you to connect with me using my email above or through my
            LinkedIn profile, linked in the header.
